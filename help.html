       <h3><b>What is the best time to visit Ladakh?</b><br></h3>
       <p>
The most popular time to visit Ladakh is during the summer months between May and August. It is important to know that most of the highways leading to and around Ladakh open up in April. May would be the month when all the action would start. Though its summer, the breeze here will still carry a comforting chill and you won’t be able to do without a blanket at nighttime. The summer months are the season when most local festivals and events happen. However, trekkers also make it to Ladakh during the extreme cold of the winters. This however would be the time when most of the roads and passes are closed due to snow and gaining a permit to places too can be a problem.
</p>
<p>
   <h3><b> What would be day time high and night time low temperature?</b></h3>
Temperature extremes in night can go as low as minus fourteen degrees in Ladakh. Day time temperature in winter months can be a comfortable 20C while in the summers (months of May and June), temperature can peak to 210C.
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b>  Which is the best route to visit Ladakh?</b></h3>
While there are several routes to visit Ladakh, one of the most highly recommended one is the Srinagar – Kargil – Leh route. However, you can take the Leh – Manali route for your return trip from Ladakh. This ensures that you won’t have to deal with a lot of altitude sickness in the return. Be ready for a highly mountainous journey.
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b> Is it safe to visit Ladakh by Bike?</b></h3>
Ladakh on a bike is a completely different kind of challenge. However, the road trip also demands that you are a responsible rider, don’t get excited too easily and are looking for fun instead of speed. It is always recommended that you ride in a group since the road is quite long can be very tasking and you never know when you would need help. However, there are many who also bike to Ladakh alone. A bike trip to Ladakh offers the flexibility of your own itinerary and you will always be free to head on to the unbeaten paths while taking the roads that have been less traveled. It’s a life altering experience altogether. You would be making new friends on the way – friends that share the same passion and approach towards live and travel it!
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b> Can I get rented bike to visit Ladakh?</b></h3>
Bike rentals are one of the most preferred and popular ways to visit Ladakh. It’s every bikers dream. While bike rentals are available from most connecting cities, the most preferred ones include Srinagar and Manali. Depending on which bike you choose, the cost may vary between INR800 and INR1600 per day. There is also an option to rent a bike from Delhi or Chandigarh but also be prepared for a very long ride and more nights on the road.
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b>  What is the process of renting a bike?</b></h3>
If you are renting a bike from Manali, you might not be able to take your bike beyond Leh. For the number of days that your bike had been parked, most rental agencies will charge about 50% of the bill. You will however need to rent another local vehicle at Leh to go around. The same applied if you rent a bike from Srinagar. The most economical way to bike through Ladakh is to rent your vehicle at Leh itself. Since no outside vehicles are allowed in Leh, this makes sense. There are several rental service providers in the fort Road.
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b> Is it safe to travel by a rented bike?</b></h3>
Traveling across Ladakh in a bike is safe as long as you stick to being a responsible driver. It is always recommended that you go in a group or pick up a packaged tour, if you are travelling alone. Being around people helps in this part of the world as the problems you can face can be multi-faceted. Before renting a bike, it is also essential that you understand the permits and regulations attached to the same.

</p>
<p>
    <h3><b> Can I find mechanics on the way in case of any problems?</b></h3>
Finding a mechanic can be a problem as most roads don’t even have proper settlements. It is necessary that you got your vehicle checked whenever you get the opportunity and feel that an expert look will be helpful. It will also be a lot of help if you have the basic knowledge of bike repairs.

<p>
    <h3><b> Is it advisable to travel in a group or solo to Ladakh?</b></h3>
It is highly advisable to travel in a group in Ladakh, regardless of the means of transport. Being in a group is always safer than traveling alone, though there have been many who do solo trips.
